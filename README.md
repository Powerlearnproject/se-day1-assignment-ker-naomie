#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of applying engineering principles, methodologies and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems through a systematic order from product design, development, testing, deployment to maintainance.
Software engineering plays a very vital role in the tech industry of enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare and also plays a very important role of enabling the creation of reliable, scalable and innovative softwares solutions that meets the user needs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Over the years, the evolution of software has gone through different milestone that include;
In 1957, the development of programming language Fortran by John Backus which aimed at handling scientifc, mathematical and statistical projects
In the 1960s, the establishment of software engineering as a disclipline.
In the 1970s, the edvent of structured programming and in the 2000s the rise  use of agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement stage- This is the first stage in the SDLC that involves the gathering and documenting the needs of the users that are involved in the project and the system requirements.
Design stage-In this stage there is high level creation and detailed designs of the software architecture user interface.
Implementation stage-This is the third stage and it involves writing codes and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing stage-Here, varios tests are conductedto ensure thatthe software meets quality standards and function requirements.
Deployment stage-As the term sounds, here the software is released to the users and customers.
Maintainance stage-This is the last stage which involves providing ongoing support updating and enhencing the system after it has been deployed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a structured/sequantial/linear approach that follows a certain or distinct phases like requirement, design, development, testing, deployment and implementation flowing downwards one after the other as a waterfall whileas agile methodology is an iteractive and incremental approach that is focused on flexibilty, team collaboration and responding to changes as soon as the occur.
Waterfall approach is simple and easy to understand as well  as it allows for future maintainance due to the fact that it emphasizes on thorough documentation which is not much considerd in agile approach.
Agile approach is flexible and adaptable, easy to accomodate changes and new developments throughout the whole process as compared to waterfall that is inflexible.
In waterfall, there is late delivery since implementation takes place in the last stage hence leading to late discoveries of defects while in Agile there is early delivery since ths appraoch focuses om frequent releasesof small working increments ensuring the the product starts delivering value early.

Waterfall approach can be used in a scenario where there is limited budget and schedule, there is need for regulatory compliance and documentation and well defined project requirements while agile can be used in scenarions where there is a well risk management system and highly experienced team

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- Responsible for code writing and implementing software solutions.

Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensuring software quality by designing and executing test plans.

Project Manager-Their work is to oversee the whole process from planning, executing and delivering of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs in software develpment process plays a role in writing, debigging and testing codes. Example; Visual studio and Eclipse

VCS in software dvelopment process also plays a role of tracking change to source and coordinate work among team members. Example; Git and Subversion 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements  which may occur during the development stage leading to scope creep and project delays and this can be solved by proper and timely communication.

Tight deadlines which involves the pressure to deliver software products on schedule which can result to rushed develpoments hence compromising quality, this can be solved by proper time management and priotitizing th most needed projects and work on them first.

Technical debt which can accrue from shortcuts and suboptimal solutions and hence impede future development efforts and increase maintainance cost which can solved by regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing for testing individual components or modules of softwares.
Integration Testing for testing interactions between different components or subcomponents.
System Testing for testing the entire system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing for testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets the user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting your questions or prompts or instuctions in a way that helps get the best responses from the AI assistants. 
Prompt engineering plays a very important role in AI models by making sure that they produce the most accurate and relevant output.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague propmt;
What is the meaning of software engineering?
Improved Prompt;
Act as an experienced software engineer and illustrate the meaning of software engineering.

The improved prompt is more effective because its more clear and personalised and it will give the accurate and relevant output
